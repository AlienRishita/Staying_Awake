          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            We came up with the idea for this project after reading an article about food waste. The article said that
            every year, millions of tons of food is wasted, while millions of people go hungry. We were shocked by
            these statistics, and we knew that we had to do something to help.
          </p>
          <p> We started by brainstorming ideas for how
            to reduce food waste. We eventually came up with the idea of a website that would connect donors with people
            who need food.
          </p>
          <p>This website would make it easy for people to donate leftover food, and it would help to
            ensure that the food is distributed to people who need it.
            We are passionate about this project because we believe that it can make a real difference in the world. We
            hope that you will join us in making this project a success.
